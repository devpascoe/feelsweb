This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project built as a sample for University Of Sydney.

You can find slides from the presentation in the "presentation-slides" folder.

## Getting Started

Create a new .env.local file in the root folder and populate the POSTGRES_URL environment variable with your own value provided by vercel postgres. You can find it in the dashboard.

To run the development server locally:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Currently `app/page.js` is left default from what comes out of the box but feel free to modify all you want. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
